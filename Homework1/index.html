<h1>The biography of William Shakespeare</h1>
<p>William Shakespeare was a renowned English poet, playwright, and actor born in <u>1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon</u>.His
    birthday is most commonly celebrated on 23 April (see When was Shakespeare born), which is also believed to be the
    date he <u>died in 1616</u>.
    Shakespeare was a prolific writer during the Elizabethan and Jacobean ages of British theatre (sometimes called the
    English Renaissance or the Early Modern Period). Shakespeare's plays are perhaps his most enduring legacy, but they
    are not all he wrote. Shakespeare's poems also remain popular to this day.</p>

<h2>Shakespeare's Family Life</h2>
<p>Records survive relating to William Shakespeare's family that offer an understanding of the context of Shakespeare's
    early life and the lives of his family members. John Shakespeare married <b>Mary Arden</b>, and together
    they had eight
    children. John and Mary lost two daughters as infants, so William became their eldest child. John Shakespeare worked
    as a glove-maker, but he also became an important figure in the town of Stratford by fulfilling civic positions. His
    elevated status meant that he was even more likely to have sent his children, including William, to the local
    grammar school.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare would have lived with his family in their house on Henley Street until he turned eighteen. When
    he was eighteen, Shakespeare married <b>Anne Hathaway</b>, who was twenty-six. It was a rushed marriage
    because Anne was
    already pregnant at the time of the ceremony. Together they had three children. Their first daughter, Susanna, was
    born six months after the wedding and was later followed by twins Hamnet and Judith. Hamnet died when he was just 11
    years old.</p>
<h3>Shakespeare's Works</h3>
<p>Altogether Shakespeare's works include <i><b>38 plays, 2 narrative poems, 154 sonnets</b></i>, and a variety of other
    poems. No
    original manuscripts of Shakespeare's plays are known to exist today. It is actually thanks to a group of actors
    from Shakespeare's company that we have about half of the plays at all. They collected them for publication after
    Shakespeare died, preserving the plays. These writings were brought together in what is known as the <strong>First
        Folio</strong>
    ('Folio' refers to the size of the paper used). It contained 36 of his plays, but none of his poetry.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's legacy is as rich and diverse as his work; his plays have spawned countless adaptations across multiple
    genres and cultures. His plays have had an enduring presence on stage and film. His writings have been compiled in
    various iterations of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, which include all of his plays, sonnets, and other
    poems. William Shakespeare continues to be one of the most important literary figures of the English language.</p>
